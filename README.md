# DataSov: A Hybrid Model for Digital Identity and Data Ownership

This project presents a novel hybrid model that strictly manages personal **digital identities (DID)** on **Corda** and enables the trading of data ownership linked to those identities on **Solana**.

By combining the strengths of both blockchains, **DataSov** creates a solution that balances user privacy with the efficient utilization of data in the real world.

### How It Works

#### **1. Corda Component: DID Management**

This layer leverages Corda's **permissioned** and **privacy-preserving** network to build a trusted identity management system.

* **Identity Registration**: A trusted identity, such as an NTT DOCOMO user ID or a government-issued digital ID, is registered on the Corda network. Corda's strict authentication is ideal for **KYC** and handling confidential information. This digital identity serves as the foundation for users to exercise data ownership.
* **Permissioned Access**: Users maintain full control over who can access their identity information and to what extent, all managed securely on Corda.

#### **2. Solana Component: Data Marketplace**

This layer utilizes Solana's **high-speed** and **low-cost** network to create an open marketplace for anonymized personal data.

* **Tokenizing Data Ownership**: Users can tokenize their anonymized personal data (e.g., smartphone location history, app usage) into **NFTs on Solana**. This process gives data a unique "ownership" that can be treated as a tradable digital asset.
* **Data Trading**: These data NFTs can be bought and sold on Solana's network by companies that need the data for analysis. In return, users receive a token fee each time their data is traded.

### Why This Combination Is Powerful

* **Balancing Trust and Efficiency**: Corda excels in enterprise use cases that demand strict security and privacy, like those involving financial institutions. In contrast, Solana is perfectly suited for high-speed, low-cost transactions within an open marketplace.
* **A Seamless User Experience**: Through a single, integrated service built on NTT DOCOMO's mobile infrastructure, users can seamlessly benefit from two different blockchains—Corda's secure identity management and Solana's active data marketplace.

**DataSov** fully leverages the strengths of each blockchain—Solana's performance and decentralization, and Corda's privacy and permissioned nature—to deliver a powerful, real-world solution.
